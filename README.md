# Mind Makers

Mind Makers is an unconventional educational initiative created by a NASA JPL engineer to help expand the future of the STEM field community. Under the mentorship of engineers from some of the most creative companies in the country, adult participants from underrepresented or unconventional backgrounds will be introduced to concepts that are key to developing technology through a hands-on and interactive project. 

See the [official website](http://www.mindmakersproject.org/) or the [project wiki](https://github.com/MindMakersProject/Curriculum/wiki) for more information on the project.
